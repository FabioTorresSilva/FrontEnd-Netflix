# Netflix Clone Project

Welcome to my Netflix clone project! This project is aimed at improving my front-end development skills by recreating the Netflix website. The goal is to make my code as clean as I can. This is something I will develop with time.

Here is the Figma file I'm working with: [Netflix Design System 2024 Website Ver](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1345502663442900887/netflix-design-system-2024-website-ver)

## Project Overview
In this project, I am creating a clone of the Netflix website. The goal is to closely mimic the design, layout, and functionality of the Netflix site. By doing this, I aim to strengthen my front-end development skills, including responsive design, CSS styling, and DOM manipulation.
